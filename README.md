# [MI3.02: Cloud and BigData With Java]


###  Master Hadoop, Spark, streaming, and scaling in BigData


## About the reporestory

This is a hand-on instructions from setup to mini-labworks to help us get familar with concepts of Hadoop and Spark, based on lectures and labworks of [Prof. Daniel Hagimont](http://sd-127206.dedibox.fr/hagimont/).


## Table of Contents

### 00. Installation prerequisite for labworks
### 01. Hadoop
You are given a file containing meterological data about cities all over the planet. You have to implement two map-reduce jobs that :
- compute the maximum temperature for each year
- compute the number of months which had a temperature higher than a given value (a parameter).
- the format of a line in the file is : day : month : year : temperature : city
### 02. Spark
Implement the same application as in the previous labwork (Hadoop), but with Spark.
### 03. Streamming
### 04. Scaling
### 05. Project
(updating)
